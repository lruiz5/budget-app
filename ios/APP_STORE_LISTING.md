## Description (4000 chars max)

Meet Happy Tusk — the zero-based budgeting app that makes sure every dollar has a job.

Most budgeting apps just track what you've spent. Happy Tusk makes you intentional about where every dollar goes _before_ you spend it. Assign your income across categories, watch your budget balance in real time, and end each month knowing exactly where your money went.

**Zero-Based Budgeting, Simplified**
Happy Tusk is built on a simple idea: income minus expenses equals zero. Every paycheck gets fully assigned — to bills, groceries, savings, or your buffer — so nothing slips through the cracks. When every dollar has a job, you're in control.

**Plan Your Month**
Build a budget from scratch or copy last month's with one tap. Organize spending across built-in categories (Income, Giving, Household, Transportation, Food, Personal, Insurance, Saving) or create your own with a custom name and emoji. Set planned amounts for each line item and watch your progress fill in as transactions come through.

**Connect Your Bank**
Link your bank accounts and sync transactions directly into Happy Tusk. Categorize transactions with a tap, split purchases across multiple budget items, and keep your budget current without manual data entry. Supports checking and credit card accounts.

**See Where Your Money Goes**
Happy Tusk's Insights tab gives you a full picture of your finances:

- Budget vs. Actual bars for every category
- Daily spending heatmap — see your heavy spending days at a glance
- Spending pace burn-down chart
- Multi-month spending trends by category
- Detailed monthly report with income, expenses, savings rate, and buffer flow

**Never Lose Track**
The "Left to Budget" banner always shows you how much income is still unassigned. Green means every dollar is placed. Orange means you have money left to plan. Red means you've over-allocated — time to adjust.

**Recurring Payments Built In**
Track subscriptions and recurring bills separately. Happy Tusk auto-advances due dates, tracks how much you've funded toward each payment, and can automatically add them to your budget when copying a previous month.

**Works Offline**
Happy Tusk caches your budget data locally so you can always view your budget, even without a connection. Mutations are blocked when offline with a clear indicator — no silent failures.

**Your Data, Secure**
Happy Tusk uses Clerk for secure authentication and never stores your bank credentials — bank connections are handled by Teller, a trusted financial data provider.
